        <h3>What are some of London's modern landmarks?</h3>

        <p>London's skyline is home to some of the world's most striking modern architecture, and in the last 50 years <br>
            many landmarks have been designed and built, five of which include:</p>

            <p> <b>1. The Shard:</b> Located next to London Bridge station, The Shard opened in 2013 and is Europe's largest<br>
                 skyscraper. The 1,017ft (309.6 meters) building contains 11,000 panes of glass and houses a hotel, several <br>
                 bars and restaurants, office space and a public observation deck on the 72nd floor, offering unrivalled <br>
                panoramic views across London.
           </p>

            <p> <b>2. The London Eye:</b> Opened on New Year's Eve 1999 and open to the public from March 2000, The London <br>
                Eye was built in celebration of the new millennium. The idea was chosen from a host of entries to a <br>
                competition held back in 1993 to create a new landmark to signify the turning of the century. Today, The <br>
                London Eye is one of London's most popular attractions visited each year, offering 360-degrees of London <br>
                from a cantilevered observation wheel.
           </p>

            <p> <b>3. 20 Fenchurch Street – The Walkie Talkie:</b> 20 Fenchurch Street opened in 2015, and was soon <br>
                nicknamed the "Walkie Talkie" building due to its aesthetic similarity. The glass front building curves subtly <br>
                 towards the Thames and unparalleled views can be enjoyed from Sky Garden situated at the top of the <br>
                 building. Experience the naturally ventilated garden over three levels, and visit one of the Fenchurch <br>
                 restaurant, Darwin Brasserie or Sky Pod Bar for delicious food and drink.

                commercial office space. The unique building has a rotating glass pattern on the building's exterior, and <br>
                each floor rotates by five degrees compared to the one below. Enjoy 360-degree city views in the <br>
                restaurant and cocktail bar, Searcys, located on level 40 of The Gherkin.
           </p>
           
            <p> <b>5. Tate Modern:</b> Since its opening in 2000, Tate Modern has become a London landmark for the stunning <br>
                architecture of the building and the art from around the world that it homes. The building was originally <br>
                used to house electricity generators for the Bankside power station, and now the space has been <br>
                transformed into gallery spaces, from paintings and film to performance and discussions.
